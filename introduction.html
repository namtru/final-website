            <h2>What Technology Did We Choose?</h2>
            <p>Our team chose to focus on <strong>DeepFake technology</strong>. DeepFakes are a type of artificially generated media—such as videos, images, or audio—created by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods. By analyzing and learning from a large amount of real media data, DeepFake algorithms can produce highly realistic but entirely fabricated content, often making it appear as though people have said or done things they never actually did.</p>

            <h2>Why Does DeepFake Technology Matter?</h2>
            <p>We chose to explore DeepFake technology because it sits at the intersection of innovation, creativity, and serious societal challenges. On one hand, DeepFakes enable compelling entertainment possibilities, more engaging educational tools, and improved creative expression. On the other hand, the same technology threatens the authenticity of information, personal privacy, and public trust.</p>
            
            <p>As digital communications continue to shape our understanding of the world, the lines between what is real and what is manipulated are becoming harder to recognize. By studying DeepFakes, we gain insights into how new technologies evolve, influence social interactions, affect legal and ethical standards, and challenge our ability to discern truth from fabrication. In essence, DeepFake technology matters because it forces us to rethink how we trust what we see and hear in a rapidly changing digital age.</p>

                <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Delving into DeepFake technology helps us understand both the promise of advanced AI-driven media and the urgent need to develop effective detection strategies, public awareness programs, and regulatory frameworks that ensure technology serves the public good.</p>
